# Product Context: Expo + Next.js Monorepo

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Traditional cross-platform development often leads to:

- **Code Duplication**: Separate codebases for mobile and web result in duplicated business logic, components, and utilities
- **Inconsistent Experiences**: Different teams working on different platforms can create divergent user experiences
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Bug fixes and feature updates must be implemented multiple times
- **Development Inefficiency**: Developers must context-switch between different codebases and toolchains
- **Testing Complexity**: Features must be tested across multiple platforms separately

### Solution Approach

This monorepo addresses these challenges by:

1. **Unified Codebase**: Single repository containing both mobile and web applications
2. **Shared Components**: Common UI components that work across platforms
3. **Shared Business Logic**: Core functionality implemented once and reused
4. **Unified Tooling**: Consistent development experience across platforms
5. **Coordinated Releases**: Synchronized updates across all platforms

## How It Should Work

### Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**: Create shared components in `packages/hello-ui`
2. **Platform Implementation**: Implement platform-specific logic in respective apps
3. **Testing**: Test components and logic across both platforms
4. **Building**: Use Turbo to efficiently build all applications
5. **Deployment**: Deploy web and mobile apps with coordinated releases

### User Experience Goals

- **Consistency**: Users should have similar experiences across mobile and web
- **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions on all platforms
- **Accessibility**: Consistent accessibility features across platforms
- **Responsiveness**: Adapt to different screen sizes and input methods

### Technical Architecture

- **Shared Layer**: Common components, utilities, and business logic
- **Platform Layer**: Platform-specific implementations and optimizations
- **Integration Layer**: APIs and services that work across platforms
- **Build Layer**: Efficient compilation and bundling for each platform

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **End Users**: People using the mobile app or web application
- **Developers**: Engineers working on cross-platform features
- **Designers**: UX/UI designers creating consistent experiences
- **Product Managers**: Stakeholders coordinating cross-platform releases

### User Needs

- **End Users**: Seamless experience regardless of platform choice
- **Developers**: Efficient development workflow with minimal friction
- **Designers**: Consistent design system that works across platforms
- **Product Managers**: Coordinated feature releases and updates

## Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity**: Faster feature development across platforms
- **Code Reuse**: Percentage of shared code between mobile and web
- **Bug Reduction**: Fewer platform-specific bugs due to shared logic
- **User Satisfaction**: Consistent experience ratings across platforms
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Reduced time spent on cross-platform maintenance

## Competitive Advantages

- **Faster Development**: Shared code reduces development time
- **Better Quality**: Single source of truth for business logic
- **Easier Maintenance**: Updates propagate across all platforms
- **Consistent UX**: Unified design system across platforms
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new platforms (desktop, TV, etc.)
