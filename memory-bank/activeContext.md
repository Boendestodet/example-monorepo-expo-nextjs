# Active Context: Expo + Next.js Monorepo

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective

**Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up comprehensive documentation system for the Expo + Next.js monorepo project to enable effective development and maintenance.

### Immediate Tasks

1. âœ… **Memory Bank Creation**: Establish foundational documentation structure
2. âœ… **Project Analysis**: Analyze existing codebase and architecture
3. âœ… **Documentation Setup**: Create core memory bank files
4. ðŸ”„ **Context Documentation**: Document current project state and patterns

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Setup

- **Created**: `memory-bank/` directory structure
- **Initialized**: Core documentation files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Project overview and requirements
  - `productContext.md`: Why and how the project works
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and technical decisions
  - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development setup
  - `activeContext.md`: Current work focus (this file)
  - `progress.md`: Project status and next steps

### Project Discovery

- **Identified**: Monorepo structure with Expo mobile and Next.js web apps
- **Analyzed**: Shared packages for UI components and configurations
